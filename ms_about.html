                Hi! My name is Emily Rochester and I’m a Web Design student at Montserrat College of Art. One day when I moved into my dorm, I visited my friend who had just recently moved into a new home nearby. I came to her house and a super crazy vision hit me as soon as I reached her doorstep.
                <br />So I also have a psychic part to me where I have incredibly vivid dreams and sometimes images or just vibes. On that day, I had this incredibly negative feeling telling me to “run run run”. I got a vision at the same time of this girl who was about to die once this tall thing fell on her. And then another vision of this TV in the attic. I just had to enter and check out her new house! Usually if I get a bad vibe, I leave. But for this one, I seriously needed to check this place out.
                <br />She welcomed me in and we chatted a bit about our lives. She has a baby niece. She was showing me pictures. So. Freaking. Cute. Anyways after a bit of chatting I asked her what was up with this place cause my stomach started hurting and as well as a headache. Probably because of the vibes. It was sickening there. She brought me up to her attic to show me a bunch of items the last owners left behind. It was a lot, and very old, and I was very surprised they left so much behind. But now, I understand why.
                <br />This website is dedicated to the items we found in her attic. I would come down to her house after school and on the weekends to work on decoding everything that happened there. I got so immersed in the process…The story is just so impressive! And Alby had taste when it came to art. I’m very impressed by his work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />I did some google searching on Alby and he actually worked on a few businesses after Mellish Sweets and they were very successful! The websites are kind of old, but here they are if you’re interested in learning more about him.
                <br />[insert invalid website links]
                <br />What I think is so important about the Mellish Sweets story is how corrupt businesses can get, and backstabbing friends. Alby never knew that Heather had the intention to practically kill a whole population of people within their town by messing with his recipes. I still don’t know exactly what was in the candy to cause such destruction…But maybe you can? I don’t know what some of these things mean. Like I found some tapes…Very odd tapes…Please let me know what you think. My email is <a href="mailto:emilyrochesty567764@gmail.com">emilyrochesty567764@gmail.com.</a>
                <br />Oh and there was one part that I had a lot of fun decoding. I got a coding friend from my school to help me make it more interactive. I hope you’ll like that part of the website!
                <br />Even though I don’t know what much of this means, I know one thing for sure. That Heather was the perpetrator behind this disaster. He destroyed the lives of many people and gave Alby lots of trauma. I know that the bad feeling that I got every time I went inside the house was because of Heather and his doings. I just know it. I’ve also had a dream that Heather was there within the house and he killed someone who looked sort of like someone who would look like his sister. And brutally. I was shaking when I woke up. Alby would never do something like that. I just know it.
